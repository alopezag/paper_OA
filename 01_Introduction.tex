\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Introduction}

Over the last few years, manufacturing companies have experienced an ever-increasing demand for more complex products with increasing product variants. As a result, the number of tasks assembly operators must master is growing accordingly. The introduction of Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies also requires operators to acquire new skills (e.g., robot programming, data analysis) linked to their changed roles and responsibilities within the production environment. The impact of this change cannot be underestimated and is, therefore, one of the main focus points for innovation in the recently defined Industry 5.0 concept. 

Currently, assembly operator support services are often limited to procedural (digital) work instructions. In case of issues, operators must rely on their knowledge and experience or require help from external experts. Digitization offers an enormous potential to provide better insights and support to the operator by gathering information and knowledge that is available in various IT information systems. However today, this potential too often remains untapped. 

In this project we will leverage this knowledge potential to develop a digital assistant (DA) which interacts with the operator and serves as a single-point-of-contact between the operator and various information sources. Based on accurate recognition of the current state of the assembly, the DA will proactively suggest what the operator should do next. When issues arise, the operator will be able to seamlessly interact ("Why doesn't this part fit?") with the DA, which relies on its understanding of the situation to provide the operator with required answers. 

Besides the clear performance gains (quality, efficiency) such a DA also provides reassurance to the operator by knowing they will receive the required support whenever they need it. New operators will be able to work independently more quickly. As an added benefit, the decreased need for external support, will increase efficiency of the supportive staff.
